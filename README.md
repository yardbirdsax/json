# My very own JSON parser

This package attempts to clean-room something close to the Go Standard Library's `encoding/json`
package. It is inspired by [this coding
challenge](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-2).
Currently, it supports a minimal subset of functionality.

* Decodes simple objects (i.e., no nested objects) with string values.
* Decodes into interface types (i.e., no structs with tags).

## Current benchmarks vs Stdlib

With the most recent improvement that streams tokens to the parser (rather than allocating a slice
with all the tokens before starting parsing) this now actually performs _better_ than the Stdlib
version.

However, it's not even close to being comparable feature-wise, so this isn't a fair competition. And
if we examine the `pprof` profile data, it's easy to see that the standard library's unmarshal logic
is likely why this is doing so much better.

Still, seeing how the performance improved so much with a slight change is interesting.
