# My very own JSON parser

This package attempts to clean-room something close to the Go Standard Library's `encoding/json`
package. It is inspired by [this coding
challenge](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-2).
Currently, it supports a minimal subset of functionality.

* Decodes simple objects (i.e., no nested objects) with string values.
* Decodes into interface types (i.e., no structs with tags).

## Current benchmarks vs Stdlib
